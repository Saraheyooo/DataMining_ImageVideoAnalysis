# DataMining_ImageVideoAnalysis

Question 1
A researcher has performed a network analysis on the dataset and now likes to know whether we can find different types of video thumbnails in different communities. In order to answer that question, she wants to categorize the video thumbnails using image classification.
Design a classification scheme (with clear definitions and examples) for catego- rizing video thumbnails in nodes.csv [column video_thumbnail]. Make sure that your classification scheme could be used by someone who hasn’t seen the data before.
Then discuss 1) why this classification scheme would be relevant to use in the context of the analysis of exercise 6.1 (e.g. what will it learn us about this data, what kind of questions can we answer with it), 2a) whether and why you think this classification model could be computationally reproduced (by a Resnet50, for example) and 2b) where there could be potential bottlenecks in reproducing this classification scheme.


Question 2
Google Images can uncover interesting cultural representations. For example, if you search for “CEO”, you will mainly see pictures of middle- aged white males; if you search for “big data”, you will see an abundance of dark blue, cyberspace-like images.
Come up with a Google Images query you want to research, explain your choice, and collect at least 50 images from this query.
Then analyze the images using one of the methods we explored in week 4, 5 or 6. Make sure to motivate your choice of method: why are the image features you chose relevant in the context of your query? Interpret the results and discuss what other features could be relevant to analyze.
